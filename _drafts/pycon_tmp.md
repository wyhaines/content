I have been a Ruby developer for well over two decades now, and before then, I made my living primarily as a Perl developer. In that time, I have been to myriad conferences around the world, but while I have made some small forays into Python, I have never been to a PyCon. That changes with PyCon 2022 US next week!

It's a trip of about eight hours by car, which is surprisingly equal to or faster than any flight(s) that I might take to get there, and while the drive may take a while, it is one that I have done many times before, and look forward to doing again. Salt Lake City is generally pretty wonderful at the end of April.

Salt Lake City's downtown area has an abundance of non-conference sights that, if you have a little time, are well worth visiting.
* [The Temple Square](https://www.visitsaltlake.com/things-to-do/attractions/historic-sites/historic-temple-square/)
* [The City Library](https://services.slcpl.org/)
* A taste of Salt Lake City's [Dirty Soda's](https://www.deseret.com/2022/1/2/22855228/utahs-dirty-soda-war-swig-sodalicious-may-give-way-to-a-revolution)
* Historical sites and art and cultural venues too numerous to list here

The list of sessions for this year's PyCon is packed with interesting content, and even if I were there primarily to attend sessions, choosing which ones to see would be challenging, as conflicts are everywhere. 

* Do I choose *Open Source on Easy Mode* or *What to Do When the Bug Is in Someone Else's Code*?
* Do I choose *Nixtla: Deep Learning para pron√≥stico de series de tiempo.* or *Observability-driven Development*?
* Do I Choose *Getting Started with Statically Typed Programming in Python 3.10* or *Serialization, more than pickling*?

For everyone is facing making these decisions over and over again for three days, I wish you well.

For those of you who are getting into Salt Lake City in tome for the workshops on the 28th, though, I suggest that you make time to attend the [*How we build software: a development and collaboration workflow to minimise context switching*](https://us.pycon.org/2022/schedule/presentation/166/) workshop. If you have never used it before, it isn't a stretch to say that [CodeStream](https://www.codestream.com/) can do some amazing things to help minimize context switching in your daily development workflow. It's a tool that is well worth learning how to use, and I highly recommend it.

For me, this event kicks of the spring/summer conference season, and I am looking forward to attending my first PyCon. Please stop by the New Relic booth and say "Hi!" I hope to see you there.
